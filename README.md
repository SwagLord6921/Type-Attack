# Type-Attack :computer:
### A beginner friendly introduction to professional touch-typing through a fun game! ###

Type Attack is an engaging way to sharpen your typing skills through game-based learning. The set up of the game is as follow:
* Random words move across the screen from left to right. :arrow_right:
* The user has to type a word and hit 'enter' before it reaches the right edge of the screen. :abc:
* The speed at which the words move will increase gradually. :fast_forward:

Technical Details:
* To move the text across the screen and for other visual elements, we will use the 'graphics.h' library.
* We will use an array of structures to store the words.
* An efficient string matching algorithm will be employed to check which words have been entered by the user.
* Using the data gathered from the game, we can estimate the user's words per minute (WPM) so they can keep track of their progress.
* Further, an additional proposal is to have a leaderboard of the best times / WPMs achieved. This can be done using files to store data.
